# Python DSA From Scratch 🐍

This repository documents my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms using Python.

### Why this repo?
- To build confidence in Python
- To practice DSA step by step
- To track consistency, not perfection

### Structure
- `00-basics` → Python fundamentals
- `01-easy` → Simple logic-based problems
- More folders will be added as I progress

### Progress Rule
- One problem at a time
- Understand > memorize
- Consistency > difficulty
